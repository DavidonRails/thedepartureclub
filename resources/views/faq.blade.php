						<p class="question">Is there a price for round-trip?</p>
						<p class="answer">Sometimes members get lucky and there will be two legs that match up…but the majority of the time these legs are just one-way and you can either fly
							commercial back or you can call Departure Club and we’ll get you a regular charter quote from our partners…WARNING-
							the pricing will be mucho higher as the cost for those legs will be standard pricing.
							Departure Club members do get access to flights from our partners at no broker fee..normally a 10% savings! </p>
